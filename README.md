# Phase 1

Phase 1 of the preliminary results focuses on the initial assessment of the effects of educational rubrics on students' self-regulation skills in introductory programming courses. This phase explores how students begin to incorporate self-regulated learning strategies, detailed in the rubrics, when facing specific tasks that require the application of fundamental programming concepts. The results discussed here illustrate changes in how students plan, execute, and reflect on their programming activities, providing insights into the effectiveness of pedagogical interventions in fostering more autonomous and engaged learning. Additionally, it details how students used the rubrics to self-assess and adjust their study and programming practices in response to specific challenges encountered during learning sessions.

## Cognitive Area

### Self-Regulation

**Task:** Practicing and understanding the fundamentals before starting programming.

**Task Importance**  

The task of reviewing and understanding the fundamentals of programming before starting to code is essential to ensure a structured and effective learning process. In introductory programming courses, a lack of conceptual mastery can lead to difficulties in implementing solutions and developing inefficient learning habits.  

This activity promotes self-regulated learning by encouraging students to identify gaps in their knowledge before facing practical challenges. Additionally, by sharing their doubts and reflections with peers and instructors, students develop collaboration and communication skills, which are essential for teamwork in programming.  

By reviewing the fundamental concepts beforehand, students arrive better prepared for the coding phase, reducing frustration and optimizing the time spent solving problems. This approach strengthens the understanding of programming principles and improves students' confidence, making the learning process smoother and more meaningful.  

**Problem Definition:** Reviewing and deeply understanding the fundamental concepts that are prerequisites for coding the solution to a programming problem specified by the instructor.

**Rubric Description:**  
Before starting to program, it is essential for students to have a solid grasp of fundamental concepts. This rubric guides students in reviewing the necessary theoretical concepts before coding, ensuring a strong foundation for problem-solving. This means they will have the opportunity to list and review key concepts in advance, share their doubts with peers and the instructor, and apply this knowledge in practice during group programming. In this way, the rubric supports structured and effective learning, promoting active and reflective student participation throughout the process.

**Step-by-Step Task Execution:**

1. **Before the Classroom Session:**  
   - Individually, after reading the problem statement, each student should list the programming concepts necessary for coding and review these concepts, noting any doubts. (Submit)  

2. **During the Classroom Session:**  
   - Share notes and doubts with the group.  
   - Discuss which concepts are considered essential and which are the most challenging. (Submit)  
   - If doubts persist, consult the instructor.  
   - Use the reviewed concepts to write a program in a group. (Submit)  

3. **After the Classroom Session:**  
   - Reflect individually on which concepts required the most effort and which may still need further review.  
   - Evaluate how the activity influenced engagement and learning during and after the flipped classroom session. (Submit)

## **Task:** Using Diagrams to Explain the Solution Design and Its Connections to the Code  

### **Task Importance**  

The use of diagrams and conceptual maps in programming plays a fundamental role in organizing and structuring students' logical thinking. Before writing code, it is essential to understand the architecture of the solution and the connections between its components. This visual approach facilitates the identification of relationships between the solution’s objectives, input, and output data, promoting more efficient planning and reducing errors during coding.  

Additionally, this practice encourages collaboration and critical thinking, as students need to integrate different perspectives to create a unified model of the solution. The activity also strengthens abstraction skills, an essential competency in programming, enabling students to understand the problem on a conceptual level before translating it into code.  

By visually mapping the solution and associating it with specific code segments, students develop a deeper understanding of programming logic, becoming more autonomous in problem-solving. This methodology not only improves code clarity but also contributes to more meaningful and structured learning, preparing students for more complex challenges in the future.  

### **Problem Definition**  
Use conceptual maps to describe the main parts of the problem, outline the solution objectives, and verify how these objectives are connected to the input and output data, aiming for the creation of a complete program.  

### **Rubric Description**  
The use of conceptual maps and diagrams helps students visualize and organize the essential parts of a programming solution before writing code. This approach facilitates the understanding of connections between program objectives and input/output data, promoting a more structured and collaborative development process.  

By applying the rubric, students will be guided to create individual visual representations, integrate their ideas in groups, relate these representations to specific code segments, and test the developed solution. In this way, the rubric helps students develop structured and logical thinking, making the programming process more efficient and comprehensible.  

### **Step-by-Step Task Execution**  

1. **Creating Individual Conceptual Maps:** Each student uses *MindMaster* software to create a conceptual map describing their solution design, including objectives and how they connect to input and output data. *(Submit individual conceptual map.)*  
2. **Group Integration:** In groups, students combine individual conceptual maps to form a unified conceptual map that describes the overall solution design, discuss different perspectives, and reach a consensus. *(Submit integrated conceptual map.)*  
3. **Coding:** Divide solution goals among group members and incorporate relevant code snippets into the conceptual map. Combine all code snippets to form the final program. *(Submit code snippets and final code.)*  
4. **Testing the Program:** Test the program to verify if it meets the defined objectives and functions correctly in different scenarios. *(Submit test results.)*
