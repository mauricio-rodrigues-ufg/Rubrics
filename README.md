## Co-Regulation and Shared Regulation  

### **Task:** Analyzing Pros and Cons in Programming  

### **Task Importance**  
Academic controversy is a collaborative learning technique that allows students to examine and refute different perspectives on a topic, fostering critical thinking and tolerance for ambiguity. This method is applied here to discuss the use of control structures in programming, specifically comparing the IF and SWITCH CASE selection structures.  

### **Problem Definition**  
Deciding which selection structure, IF or SWITCH CASE, is more appropriate for a problem specified by the teacher, considering the theoretical and practical aspects of each.  

### **Rubric Description**  
The academic controversy strategy used in this activity enables students to critically analyze control structures in programming, comparing IF and SWITCH CASE in a reflective and practical manner. This method stimulates critical thinking, teaching students to defend and refute arguments even if they do not align with their personal opinions. Additionally, by implementing both structures, students gain hands-on experience and learn to evaluate advantages and disadvantages in different programming scenarios. This process strengthens evidence-based decision-making skills, preparing students for real-world challenges in software development.  

### **Step-by-Step Task Execution**  
1. **Individual Preparation:** Each student reflects individually on the benefits of the academic controversy technique (submit reflections).  
2. **Pair Debate:** In pairs, students prepare and present arguments for and against using IF and SWITCH CASE structures, regardless of their personal opinions (submit prepared arguments).  
3. **Group Discussion:** Pairs are merged into a group of four, where they discuss the pros and cons, trying to reach a consensus. If they cannot, they prepare a report outlining the different perspectives (submit the report or consensus conclusion).  
4. **Practical Implementation:** Implement at least two versions of the algorithms, one for each control structure, and discuss their practical advantages and disadvantages (submit the codes and discussions).  

## Teacher’s Rubric
